Now he is looking for quotes to replace all the lawn and planting beds on his property. Bob has received quotes from other companies that have been rejected by the insurance company. the quotes range from $19k-$27k. The biggest issue the insurance company has is that the plants should not be included in the quote, because they feel the plants didn't burn up in the fire; and that they were removed by the company building the home. So, bob would like a quote from trace to install a new lawn and install new beds without the plantings. Timing: fall 2015 Budget: $10-$15k"

However, he has been really slacking in service recently. They typically go with the lowest bid. However, due to lack of good service, they are considering paying more for better service.

She just wants it done correctly this time She is sick to her stomach that she even has to consider redoing the entire thing. Stoney Creek Landscaping installed all of her hardscaping in the past.

At the end of the 3-yr contract, the contract renewal price was double from the original agreement. It was too much for Joe to pull the trigger. C&M landscaping provided the plaza with snow maintenance last year, and Joe received a lot of calls from their tenants about poor winter service. Joe has since lost two tenants in the plaza in the past year; not sure if it is a coincidence or not. Either way, Joe is interested in having Trace put together some winter maintenance numbers for this upcoming year. He is willing to sign a 3-year deal as long as its a number that is manageable. His biggest issue last year was that he got hit hard with additional costs related to having the company pile or remove snow. he wants to get away from that.

SO, ken and louise would like to reshape the bed and cut back the drain pipes so it all lies on their own property. They would also like to fix the drainage issue around the driveway; tie it into existing catch-basin, which ties into drainage that needs cut back.

They have used other landscapers in previous years, and had bad experiences. Timiing: no hurry on the project work. Mowing needs done sooner than later. Budget: project ($1500); mow ($50 per time)"

Also looking to have new porch built in front of home. Has received quotes for it in the neighborhood of $10k. never considered paver patio; but after discussing it with him, he may be interested in doing so. wants to reconnect end of week or beginning of next week to discuss both projects in more details."
0016000000oBC9d,johncascio,26-03-2015,Initial Meeting,UPMC NW,a,"met with Dick Snyder and John Williams. discussed current services, service providers, likes, dislikes/struggles, and UPMC locations in cranberry, franklin , oil city areas. They currently receive year round maintenance at the Cranberry Hospital, Seneca Place in Seneca, and MRI in Reno/Franklin. They currently use a handful of different service providers. The only one they are happy with is the mowing company for the hospital only. STRUGGLES: they had a very hard winter. The guy they have been using for years, could not handle the harsh winter this year. Now, john Williams is looking for better quality instead of cheaper price. they had more slip and falls this year than they had in a long time. They cant have that anymore. SOW: HOSPITAL - plow @ 1"" trigger and de-ice as needed. sidewalk shovel and de-ice, mow weekly, bed maintenance to include mulching weeding, and pruning. SENECA PLACE - plow @ 1"" trigger and de-ice as needed. sidewalk shovel and de-ice, mow weekly, bed maintenance to include pruning.

00160000019MD6F,johncascio,23-03-2015,Initial Meeting,Noticewala Residence,a,"met with dr. noticewala at his conn lake home. cuurently under a lot of construction (redoing some stuff inside, and also redoing the siding). he recently bought the home which was originally built in 1925. it sits on a very steep bank with minimal access to back of home. would like the entire front portion of the property redone with retaining walls, plantings, steps, and whatever else we can do to make the property look more appealing. He is most concerned about the property appeal when talking about the front. The side, he would like to make it more appealing using some of the existing stone that currently exists as walls and steps. The back needs a whole new set of steps that leads from the house to the top of the steep hill. With the back, he is only concerned with functionality and not so much appeal. the new siding should be done within the next few weeks. Timing: Spring 2015 Budget: $75k-$90k"

0016000000oCJMB,johncascio,19-03-2015,Initial Meeting,Honeywell,a,"talked to Elana Blunchette in RI. looking for last minute cleanup for their facility in franklin. Jan Miller, the site manager, referred us. Kristen Mitchell no longer works for them, and Elana is now responsible for sourcing out their maintenance for all of their North America facilities. Immediate need for spring clean-up and lot sweeping. Near future needs for summer maintenance and winter maintenance. BUDGET: anything under $1000 does not need approval from Rhode Island. They are not opposed to being creative to keep RI out of the equation."

SOW: retaining wall on both sides of door leading out of basement. remove existing cinder block wall and concrete pad in subject area. would like the wall to be higher (approx. 3-4' high), so that it is easier for him to mow area behind the wall. he's getting older, and makes it hard to mow the hillside the way it stands right now. open to ideas. ** there is an existing sewer line that may need a new pipe running from house to holding tank. Timing: spring 2015 Budget: $7500"

00160000019Lw7N,johncascio,12-03-2015,Initial Meeting,UPMC Greenville Hospital,a,"met with don. discussed year-rd outdoor maintenance. - currently using Ruppert out of hermitage for mowing services at the Greenville and Sharon facilities. Using Gosnell tree service for pruning and trimming; using landfried paving for winter services. - SUMMER: Ruppert is currently providing services to all 3 Greenville facilitites (hospital, wellness center, and medical center). for the most part, they are happy with him. biggest issue is that ruppert is a school teacher, and only does the mowing on weekends. If it rains on the weekend, it causes problems with the properties getting serviced; and they tend to go w a couple of weeks at a time without mowing service. other than that, the price is right, and he's a good guy. they are willing to switch for the right company. WINTER: they had a lot of issues with landfried last year. no communication, and couldn't keep up with their demand. winter services are similar to how we manage the Meadville medical center. the only exception is that they use in-house employees for the maintenance at the main hospital. MEDICAL CENTER: mowing regularly, mulching one time, pruning bushes 2 times, weeding beds one time, plowing shoveling the walks. WELLNESS CENTER: mowing regularly, plowing shoveling the walks. HOSPITAL: mowing regularly, pruning bushes 2 times, weeding beds one time, TIMING: Spring 2015 BUDGET: $8000 for mowing// $240 per plow/shovel/de-ice"

However, she really likes the benches, and may just decide to go with both. She just needs to sell her husband on the whole idea."
